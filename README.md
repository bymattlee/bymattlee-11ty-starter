## General Features
* Features [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) as the build pipeline that renders HTML, compiles styles and scripts, and optimizes assets.
* Data is coming from the Sanity Cloud API. This pairs perfectly with the [ByMattLee Sanity Studio Starter](https://github.com/bymattlee/bymattlee-sanity-studio-starter)
* Spins up a local development environment through Browsersync
* Browser reload when NJK, JS, image, SVG or asset files are updated
* Styles are injected when SCSS files are updated

##### Markup
* Features [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) as the static site generator
* Markup is minified in staging and production environments
* Site data can be set in `src/site/_data`
* Pages in `src/site` will be compiled to `dist`
* `src/site/_includes/layouts/base.njk` serves as the base template for the site
* `src/site/_includes/partials` contains site partials and components that are reused across the site (modular HTML)

##### Styles
* Features [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first framework
* Includes linter (Stylelint), autoprefixer, minification and sourcemap creation
* SCSS files are located in `src/assets/scss`
* `main.scss` in `src/assets/scss` serves as the base that includes the other dependent SASS files
* `main.scss` gets compiled to `dist/assets/css/main.min.css`
* `.stylelintrc` contains the settings for Stylelint
* Info about class namespacing can be found in `src/assets/scss/main.scss`
* Unused CSS (PurgeCSS) will be removed in staging and production builds

##### Scripts
* Features [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) as the module bundler
* Includes linting (ESLint), concatenation, minification and sourcemap creation
* Includes [Highway](https://highway.js.org/) for seamless page transitions
* Includes a custom framework for reuseable content animations
* Includes [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) for declarative DOM manipulation
* `main.js` in `src/assets/js` serves as the main JS file that includes and runs all components and will be compiled to `dist/assets/js/main.min.js`
* All local components should be placed in `src/assets/js/components`
* All vendor JS can be manually added to `src/assets/js/vendors` if not found on Yarn
* `.eslintrc` contains the settings for ESLint

##### Images
* Place all unoptimized images in the `src/assets/images` directory
* They will then be optimized and placed in `dist/assets/images`
* Responsive images will be generated at the following widths (if larger): 200w, 400w, 600w, 800w, 1000w, 1200w, 1400w, 1600w, 1800w
* Use `imageSrc` shortcode to render responsive `srcset` in markup

##### SVGS
* Place all SVG files in the `src/assets/svg` directory
* They will then be optimized and added to a sprite at `dist/assets/svg/sprite.svg`

##### Other Assets
* All assets (fonts, videos, swfs, etc) under `src/assets` will be copied to `dist/assets` on build

##### Sitemap
* Generates a sitemap based on the HTML files in `dist`

##### Robots.txt
* Generates a robots.txt file
* Configuration can be found in `src/site/robots.njk`
___
## Tailwind CSS Notes
* All Tailwind settings can be found in `./tailwind.config.js`
* Most styles should be written as utility classes in the template markup but custom SCSS can be used for unique properties and/or magic numbers
* Utilize the [`@apply`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#apply) directive when writing custom SCSS for efficiency:
```scss
svg {
    @apply inline-block fill-current;
}
```
* Tailwind settings can be accessed with the [`theme()`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#theme) function:
```scss
.button {
    animation-duration: theme('transitionDuration.normal');
}
```
* Media queries can be used with the shorthand `screen()` function:
```scss
.button {
    margin-right: 2.8rem;
    @screen sm {
        margin-right: 4.2rem;
    }
}
```
